# Cartizee

Cartizee is a simple shopping cart application built using Firebase as its database. It is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that allows users to add items to their cart. Just a simple click on the item will remove it from the cart. The cart is persistent, meaning that the items will remain in the cart even after the user closes the app.

### What I learned

This project enabled me to learn how to integrate Firebase realtime database with a web application, enabling real-time updates and synchronization of data across multiple clients. I also learned how to convert a web application into a PWA, that adapts to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal user experience.
